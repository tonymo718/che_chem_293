What does the model achieve? 
-This graph shows the linear relationship between the battery capacity and the charge cycles

How should metrics be interpreted?
-Slope is the relationship between the number of charge cycles and Capacity for the battery; R value is not as good as expected

What are appropriate use cases?
-As the charge cycles the battery increase, the capacity will get lower and lower.

How is it implemented? *
- Data were obtained by using the same battery, charged at the same rate, and time.

What are caveats/biases/concerns to its usage?
-The numbers can be changed easily trying to get a better fit and R-value.

How to interpret this specific result and advising action/next steps? 
-We can look at the x and y coordinates and see around which cycles that the battery capacity drops significantly and can set up experiments on improving the battery life/capacity.
